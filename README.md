## Projects
### gigaMAP - Port Scanning Tool
[Repo Link](https://github.com/eyoo217/gigaMAP)

- gigaMAP is a port scanner inspired by the nmap scanner that returns any open ports on a network.
- gigaMAP takes in a website url or an ip address as a parameter and returns open ports and the ports status.
- to run, install the main.go file make sure go is installed (you can test this by typing go version) run "go run main.go"
- now you can scan ports with ease using gigaMAP!
